We want to make the same causal conclusions from observational studies and those from experimental studies. We can do that by studying causal inference.</p><div id=simpsons class="section level2"><h2>Simpson’s Paradox</h2>An example of the importance of understanding causal relationships is given by Simpson’s Paradox <span class=citation>(<a href=#ref-simpson1951interpretation role=doc-biblioref>Simpson 1951</a>)</span>, which describes a peculiar phenomenon that can present in data sets, where a correlation between two variables is present in one direction but reverses in each stratum of the data. The paradox expressed best through an example:
<label for=tufte-mn- class=margin-toggle>⊕</label><input type=checkbox id=tufte-mn- class=margin-toggle><span class=marginnote>This appears to suggest that the more someone exercises, the higher their cholesterol is!

At first glance, this seems absurd, but when we partition the data by another causal variable, this seems reasonable:<div class=figure><span id=fig:simpsons-after></span><img src=index_files/figure-html/simpsons-after-1.png alt="The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age" width=672><p class=caption>Figure 2: The same results as the experiment above, partioned by age</p></div><p><label for=tufte-mn- class=margin-toggle>⊕</label><input type=checkbox id=tufte-mn- class=margin-toggle><span class=marginnote>(Also note, we have fabricated the data, although these relationships are quite plausible)</span>
Understanding the full causal story is essential. Without an entire causal narrative, we might recommend inappropriate interventions; for example, a doctor might prescribe less exercise to reduce cholesterol in the case above.</p><p>To deduce such causal stories, we need to apply the methodology of causal inference.</p></div><div id=structural-equation-models-and-causal-graphs class="section level2"><h2>Structural Equation Models and Causal Graphs</h2><p>A structural equation model (SEM) is a set of equations representing the relationship between variables. For example, the equations which generated the data from <a href=#simpsons>the Simpson’s paradox example</a>, are given as:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
age &= U_1 \\
exercise &= \frac{1}{13}*age + U_2 \\
cholesteral &= -4*exercise + age + U_3
\end{align*}
\]</span>
We can think of <span class="math inline">\(U_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(U_3\)</span> as specific unobserved exogenous variables of an individual, which generate their endogenous variables (something like error terms).</p><p>A causal graph is a DAG which describes the existence of relationships between variables in a model. An edge <code>x -> y</code> represents the relationship <code>x</code> directly causes <code>y</code>. Consequently, causal graphs can represent SEMs:
<img src=index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png width=672></p><p>Indeed this graph shows how age confounds the effect of exercise on cholesterol.</p></div><div id=do-calculus class="section level2"><h2>Do-calculus</h2><p><span class=citation><a href=#ref-pearl1995causal role=doc-biblioref>Pearl</a> (<a href=#ref-pearl1995causal role=doc-biblioref>1995</a>)</span> outline a method to remove this confounding (and other similar scenarios) using do-calculus. Outlining the specifics of do-calculus is beyond the scope of this blog post (but for interested readers, we suggest <span class=citation>(<a href=#ref-pearl2016causal role=doc-biblioref>Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell 2016</a>)</span>). In brief, do-calculus introduces the <span class="math inline">\(do()\)</span> operator, which acts as an intervention and fixes a variable to a particular constant. For example, consider a similar binary situation to <a href=#simpsons>the Simpson’s paradox example</a>, where <em>exer</em> is a binary variable true if the individual is active, <em>chol</em> is a binary variable true if the individual has high cholesterol, and <em>age</em> is a binary variable true if the individual is over 60.</p><pre class=r><code>bin_simpsons_data &lt;- simpsons_data %&gt;%
  mutate(age = age &gt; 60) %&gt;% # Binarize the age, so those over 60 are True, and under 60 are False
  mutate(exer = exercise&gt;mean(exercise)) %&gt;% # Binarize the exercise level, so those above the average are True, and under are False
  mutate(chol = cholesteral&gt;mean(cholesteral)) # Binarize the cholesteral level, so those above the average are True, and under are False</code></pre><p>We ask the same experimental question; does exercise reduce cholesterol. A naive approach would be to compute the effect as <span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer = 1) - P(chol | exer = 0)=\)</span> 0.168, where <span class="math inline">\(P(chol | exer)\)</span> is computed by filtering the data according to <em>exer</em>. Taking this approach, we would erroneously observe that the effect was positive since those who exercise more are also old and more likely to have high cholesterol.</p><p>The experimental best practice approach would be to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A random selection of individuals are assigned to <em>do</em> a high exercise regiment and the others <em>do</em> a low exercise regiment (regardless of age). The RCT implicitly removes the natural tendency of exercise to vary with age and allows researchers to observe the causal effect of exercise on cholesterol. When using data generated in such a fashion, increases/decreases in the probability of having high cholesterol caused by exercise are given by <span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 1) - P_{RCT}(chol | exer = 0)\)</span>. This metric is known as the Average Causal Effect (ACE), sometimes called the Average Treatment Effect. Note that by conditioning on <span class="math inline">\(exer=x\)</span>, with data generated by an RCT, researchers are essentially limiting the data used to estimate <span class="math inline">\(P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)</span>, to individuals who were <strong>forced</strong> to <em>do</em> an exercise regiment <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The <em>do</em> here represents forcing individuals to take an intervention value, regardless of their natural tendency, and this is captured by the <span class="math inline">\(do()\)</span> operator. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = x)) = P_{RCT}(chol | exer = x)\)</span>, since the data was generated with an RCT. However, RCTs can be prohibitively expensive (both in time and money) and might not be necessary to tease out a causal effect.</p><p>We would still like to estimate the ACE, <span class="math inline">\(P(chol | do(exer = 1)) - P(chol | do(exer = 0))\)</span>, by using data that wasn’t generated from an RCT. By using the <span class="math inline">\(do()\)</span> operator here, we aim to disassociate <em>exer</em> from its natural tendency with <em>age</em> and effectively perform a graph surgery:</p><p><img src=index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png width=672></p><p><span class=citation><a href=#ref-pearl2016causal role=doc-biblioref>Pearl, Glymour, and Jewell</a> (<a href=#ref-pearl2016causal role=doc-biblioref>2016</a>)</span> provide an adjustment formula for just this scenario:
<span class="math display">\[
P(y|do(x)) = \sum_z \frac{P(X=x, Y=y, PA=z)}{P(X=x| PA=z)}
\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> represents the variable we are acting on, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> the variable we measure results from, and <span class="math inline">\(PA\)</span> the parents of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> or more generally any nodes that satisfy the back-door criterion (which we will introduce later). Note this allows us to derive the causal effect, as if we had generated data with an RCT, using only probabilities estimated from data not generated by an RCT.</p><p>As such we compute our ACE for the binary scenario:</p><pre class=r><code># The Joint Distribution P(age, exer, chol) i.e. P(x,y,z)
